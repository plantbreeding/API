Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
=============================

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, or CORS, is a set of security checks done
by a web browser to confirm that the web page displayed is allowed to
retrieve data from a different server. CORS issues often come up when
dealing with APIs, particularly when data is being shared from several
different sources. It is important to configure CORS settings correctly,
open enough for a good user experience, but restricted enough to prevent
requests for data from undesirable sources. CORS helps to prevent Cross
Site Scripting and other similar attacks.
