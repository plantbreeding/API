Germplasm
----------

Fun Fact: The plural of germplasm is germplasm (no "s").


Germplasm Attributes
--------------------

Germplasm "attributes" are simply-inherited characteristics (characterization descriptors) 
that are not environment-dependent but inherent in the germplasm line. They include genes, 
QTLs, and genetic "traits" like wheat grain hardness. They are often evaluated by 
genotyping for diagnostic markers.

Pedigree
---------

These end points can be used to interact with Pedigree Trees. Each response will be a set 
of Pedigree Node objects. Each of these Node objects represent a particular Germplasm and 
all the links to its parents, siblings, and children. From a list of Node objects, a 
client application should have all the information it needs to draw a Pedigree tree 
visualization, or calculate genetic distances.
