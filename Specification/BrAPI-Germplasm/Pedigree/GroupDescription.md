# Group Pedigree
These end points can be used to interact with Pedigree Trees. Each response will be a set of Pedigree Node objects. Each of these Node objects represent a particular Germplasm and all the links to its parents, siblings, and children. From a list of Node objects, a client application should have all the information it needs to draw a Pedigree tree visualization, or calculate genetic distances.
