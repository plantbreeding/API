# Group Pedigree
These end points can be used to interact with Pedigree Trees. Each response will be a set of Pedigree Node objects. Each of these Node objects represent a particular Germplasm and all the links to its parents, siblings, and children. From a list of Node objects, a client application should have all the information it needs to draw a Pedigree tree visualization, or calculate genetic distances.

Any persistent, unique identifier assigned to the accession so it can be unambiguously referenced at the global level and the information associated with it harvested through automated means. Report one PUID for each accession. The Secretariat of the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (PGRFA) is facilitating the assignment of a persistent unique identifier (PUID), in the form of a DOI, to PGRFA at the accession level. Genebanks not applying a true PUID to their accessions should use, and request recipients to use, the concatenation of INSTCODE, ACCENUMB, and GENUS as a globally unique identifier similar in most respects to the PUID whenever they exchange information on accessions with third parties.|
|parents|array[object]|A list of parent germplasm references in the pedigree tree for this germplasm. These represent edges in the tree, connecting to other nodes. <br/> Typically, this array should only have one parent (clonal or self) or two parents (cross).

**Request Fields** 

|Field|Type|Description|
|---|---|---| 


**Response Fields** 

|Field|Type|Description|
|---|---|---| 
|data|array[object]||
|additionalInfo|object|Additional arbitrary info|
|breedingMethodDbId|string|The unique identifier for the breeding method used to create this germplasm|
|breedingMethodName|string|The human readable name of the breeding method used to create this germplasm|
|crossingProjectDbId|string|The crossing project used to generate this germplasm|
|crossingYear|integer|The year the parents were originally crossed|
|defaultDisplayName|string|Human readable name used for display purposes|
|externalReferences|array[object]|An array of external reference ids. These are references to this piece of data in an external system. Could be a simple string or a URI.|
|referenceID|string|**Deprecated in v2.1** Please use `referenceId`. Github issue number #460   The external reference ID. Could be a simple string or a URI.|
|referenceId|string|The external reference ID. Could be a simple string or a URI.|
|referenceSource|string|An identifier for the source system or database of this reference|
|familyCode|string|The code representing the family of this germplasm|
|germplasmDbId|string|The ID which uniquely identifies a germplasm|
|germplasmName|string|A human readable name for a germplasm|
|germplasmPUI|string|The Permanent Unique Identifier which represents a germplasm  MIAPPE V1.1 (DM-41) Biological material ID - Code used to identify the biological material in the data file. Should be unique within the Investigation. Can correspond to experimental plant ID, seed lot ID, etc This material identification is different from a BiosampleID which corresponds to Observation Unit or Samples sections below.  MIAPPE V1.1 (DM-51) Material source DOI - Digital Object Identifier (DOI) of the material source  MCPD (v2.1) (PUID) 0. Any persistent, unique identifier assigned to the accession so it can be unambiguously referenced at the global level and the information associated with it harvested through automated means. Report one PUID for each accession. The Secretariat of the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (PGRFA) is facilitating the assignment of a persistent unique identifier (PUID), in the form of a DOI, to PGRFA at the accession level. Genebanks not applying a true PUID to their accessions should use, and request recipients to use, the concatenation of INSTCODE, ACCENUMB, and GENUS as a globally unique identifier similar in most respects to the PUID whenever they exchange information on accessions with third parties.|
|parents|array[object]|A list of parent germplasm references in the pedigree tree for this germplasm. These represent edges in the tree, connecting to other nodes. <br/> Typically, this array should only have one parent (clonal or self) or two parents (cross). In some special cases, there may be more parents, usually when the exact parent is not known.  <br/> If the parameter 'includeParents' is set to false, then this array should be empty, null, or not present in the response.|
|germplasmDbId|string|The ID which uniquely identifies a germplasm|
|germplasmName|string|A human readable name for a germplasm|
|parentType|string|The type of parent used during crossing. Accepted values for this field are 'MALE', 'FEMALE', 'SELF', 'POPULATION', and 'CLONAL'.   In a pedigree record, the 'parentType' describes each parent of a particular germplasm.   In a progeny record, the 'parentType' is used to describe how this germplasm was crossed to generate a particular progeny.  For example, given a record for germplasm A, having a progeny B and C. The 'parentType' field for progeny B item refers  to the 'parentType' of A toward B. The 'parentType' field for progeny C item refers to the 'parentType' of A toward C. In this way, A could be a male parent to B, but a female parent to C. |
|pedigreeString|string|The string representation of the pedigree for this germplasm in PURDY notation|
|progeny|array[object]|A list of germplasm references that are direct children of this germplasm. These represent edges in the tree, connecting to other nodes. <br/> The given germplasm could have a large number of progeny, across a number of different breeding methods. The 'parentType' shows        the type of parent this germplasm is to each of the child germplasm references. <br/> If the parameter 'includeProgeny' is set to false, then this array should be empty, null, or not present in the response.|
|germplasmDbId|string|The ID which uniquely identifies a germplasm|
|germplasmName|string|A human readable name for a germplasm|
|parentType|string|The type of parent used during crossing. Accepted values for this field are 'MALE', 'FEMALE', 'SELF', 'POPULATION', and 'CLONAL'.   In a pedigree record, the 'parentType' describes each parent of a particular germplasm.   In a progeny record, the 'parentType' is used to describe how this germplasm was crossed to generate a particular progeny.  For example, given a record for germplasm A, having a progeny B and C. The 'parentType' field for progeny B item refers  to the 'parentType' of A toward B. The 'parentType' field for progeny C item refers to the 'parentType' of A toward C. In this way, A could be a male parent to B, but a female parent to C. |
|siblings|array[object]|A list of sibling germplasm references in the pedigree tree for this germplasm. These represent edges in the tree, connecting to other nodes. <br/> Siblings share at least one parent with the given germplasm.  <br/> If the parameter 'includeSiblings' is set to false, then this array should be empty, null, or not present in the response.|
|germplasmDbId|string|The ID which uniquely identifies a germplasm|
|germplasmName|string|A human readable name for a germplasm|

### Post - /search/pedigree [POST /brapi/v2/search/pedigree]

Submit a search request for `Pedigree`<br/>
Search requests allow a client to send a complex query for data. However, the server may not respond with the search results immediately. 
If a server needs more time to process the request, it might respond with a `searchResultsDbId`. 
Use the corresponding `GET /search/germplasm/{searchResultsDbId}` to retrieve the results of the search. <br/> 
Review the <a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.brapi.org/index.php/Search_Services#POST_Search_Entity">Search Services documentation</a> for additional implementation details.

MIAPPE V1.1 (DM-51) Material source DOI - Digital Object Identifier (DOI) of the material source  MCPD (v2.1) (PUID) 0. Any persistent, unique identifier assigned to the accession so it can be unambiguously referenced at the global level and the information associated with it harvested through automated means. Report one PUID for each accession. The Secretariat of the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (PGRFA) is facilitating the assignment of a persistent unique identifier (PUID), in the form of a DOI, to PGRFA at the accession level. Genebanks not applying a true PUID to their accessions should use, and request recipients to use, the concatenation of INSTCODE, ACCENUMB, and GENUS as a globally unique identifier similar in most respects to the PUID whenever they exchange information on accessions with third parties.|
|parents|array[object]|A list of parent germplasm references in the pedigree tree for this germplasm. These represent edges in the tree, connecting to other nodes. <br/> Typically, this array should only have one parent (clonal or self) or two parents (cross).

In a pedigree record, the 'parentType' describes each parent of a particular germplasm.   In a progeny record, the 'parentType' is used to describe how this germplasm was crossed to generate a particular progeny.  For example, given a record for germplasm A, having a progeny B and C. The 'parentType' field for progeny B item refers  to the 'parentType' of A toward B. The 'parentType' field for progeny C item refers to the 'parentType' of A toward C. In this way, A could be a male parent to B, but a female parent to C. |

|progeny|array[object]|A list of germplasm references that are direct children of this germplasm. These represent edges in the tree, connecting to other nodes. <br/> The given germplasm could have a large number of progeny, across a number of different breeding methods. The 'parentType' shows        the type of parent this germplasm is to each of the child germplasm references. <br/> If the parameter 'includeProgeny' is set to false, then this array should be empty, null, or not present in the response.|
|germplasmDbId|string|The ID which uniquely identifies a germplasm|
|germplasmName|string|A human readable name for a germplasm|
|parentType|string|The type of parent used during crossing. Accepted values for this field are 'MALE', 'FEMALE', 'SELF', 'POPULATION', and 'CLONAL'.   In a pedigree record, the 'parentType' describes each parent of a particular germplasm.

### Get - /search/pedigree/{searchResultsDbId} [GET /brapi/v2/search/pedigree/{searchResultsDbId}{?page}{?pageSize}]

Get the results of a `Pedigree` search request <br/>
Clients should submit a search request using the corresponding `POST /search/germplasm` endpoint.
Search requests allow a client to send a complex query for data. However, the server may not respond with the search results immediately. 
If a server needs more time to process the request, it might respond with a `searchResultsDbId`. 
Use this endpoint to retrieve the results of the search. <br/> 
Review the <a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.brapi.org/index.php/Search_Services#POST_Search_Entity">Search Services documentation</a> for additional implementation details.



**Response Fields** 

|Field|Type|Description|
|---|---|---| 
|data|array[object]||
|additionalInfo|object|Additional arbitrary info|
|breedingMethodDbId|string|The unique identifier for the breeding method used to create this germplasm|
|breedingMethodName|string|The human readable name of the breeding method used to create this germplasm|
|crossingProjectDbId|string|The crossing project used to generate this germplasm|
|crossingYear|integer|The year the parents were originally crossed|
|defaultDisplayName|string|Human readable name used for display purposes|
|externalReferences|array[object]|An array of external reference ids. These are references to this piece of data in an external system. Could be a simple string or a URI.|
|referenceID|string|**Deprecated in v2.1** Please use `referenceId`. Github issue number #460   The external reference ID. Could be a simple string or a URI.|
|referenceId|string|The external reference ID. Could be a simple string or a URI.|
|referenceSource|string|An identifier for the source system or database of this reference|
|familyCode|string|The code representing the family of this germplasm|
|germplasmDbId|string|The ID which uniquely identifies a germplasm|
|germplasmName|string|A human readable name for a germplasm|
|germplasmPUI|string|The Permanent Unique Identifier which represents a germplasm  MIAPPE V1.1 (DM-41) Biological material ID - Code used to identify the biological material in the data file. Should be unique within the Investigation. Can correspond to experimental plant ID, seed lot ID, etc This material identification is different from a BiosampleID which corresponds to Observation Unit or Samples sections below.  MIAPPE V1.1 (DM-51) Material source DOI - Digital Object Identifier (DOI) of the material source  MCPD (v2.1) (PUID) 0. Any persistent, unique identifier assigned to the accession so it can be unambiguously referenced at the global level and the information associated with it harvested through automated means. Report one PUID for each accession. The Secretariat of the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (PGRFA) is facilitating the assignment of a persistent unique identifier (PUID), in the form of a DOI, to PGRFA at the accession level. Genebanks not applying a true PUID to their accessions should use, and request recipients to use, the concatenation of INSTCODE, ACCENUMB, and GENUS as a globally unique identifier similar in most respects to the PUID whenever they exchange information on accessions with third parties.|
|parents|array[object]|A list of parent germplasm references in the pedigree tree for this germplasm. These represent edges in the tree, connecting to other nodes. <br/> Typically, this array should only have one parent (clonal or self) or two parents (cross). In some special cases, there may be more parents, usually when the exact parent is not known.  <br/> If the parameter 'includeParents' is set to false, then this array should be empty, null, or not present in the response.|
|germplasmDbId|string|The ID which uniquely identifies a germplasm|
|germplasmName|string|A human readable name for a germplasm|
|parentType|string|The type of parent used during crossing. Accepted values for this field are 'MALE', 'FEMALE', 'SELF', 'POPULATION', and 'CLONAL'.   In a pedigree record, the 'parentType' describes each parent of a particular germplasm.   In a progeny record, the 'parentType' is used to describe how this germplasm was crossed to generate a particular progeny.  For example, given a record for germplasm A, having a progeny B and C. The 'parentType' field for progeny B item refers  to the 'parentType' of A toward B. The 'parentType' field for progeny C item refers to the 'parentType' of A toward C. In this way, A could be a male parent to B, but a female parent to C. |
|pedigreeString|string|The string representation of the pedigree for this germplasm in PURDY notation|
|progeny|array[object]|A list of germplasm references that are direct children of this germplasm. These represent edges in the tree, connecting to other nodes. <br/> The given germplasm could have a large number of progeny, across a number of different breeding methods. The 'parentType' shows        the type of parent this germplasm is to each of the child germplasm references. <br/> If the parameter 'includeProgeny' is set to false, then this array should be empty, null, or not present in the response.|
|germplasmDbId|string|The ID which uniquely identifies a germplasm|
|germplasmName|string|A human readable name for a germplasm|
|parentType|string|The type of parent used during crossing. Accepted values for this field are 'MALE', 'FEMALE', 'SELF', 'POPULATION', and 'CLONAL'.   In a pedigree record, the 'parentType' describes each parent of a particular germplasm.   In a progeny record, the 'parentType' is used to describe how this germplasm was crossed to generate a particular progeny.  For example, given a record for germplasm A, having a progeny B and C. The 'parentType' field for progeny B item refers  to the 'parentType' of A toward B. The 'parentType' field for progeny C item refers to the 'parentType' of A toward C. In this way, A could be a male parent to B, but a female parent to C. |
|siblings|array[object]|A list of sibling germplasm references in the pedigree tree for this germplasm. These represent edges in the tree, connecting to other nodes. <br/> Siblings share at least one parent with the given germplasm.  <br/> If the parameter 'includeSiblings' is set to false, then this array should be empty, null, or not present in the response.|
|germplasmDbId|string|The ID which uniquely identifies a germplasm|
|germplasmName|string|A human readable name for a germplasm|
