        Submit a search request for `CallSets` 
        <br> Search requests allow a client to send a complex query for data. However, the server may not respond with the search results immediately. 
        If a server needs more time to process the request, it might respond with a `searchResultsDbId`. 
        Use the corresponding `GET /search/callsets/{searchResultsDbId}` to retrieve the results of the search. 
        <br> Review the <a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.brapi.org/index.php/Search_Services#POST_Search_Entity">Search Services documentation</a> for additional implementation details.
