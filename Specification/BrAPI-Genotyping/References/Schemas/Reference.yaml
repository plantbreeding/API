    Reference:
      description: A `Reference` is a canonical assembled contig, intended to act as a reference coordinate space for other genomic annotations. A single `Reference` might represent the human chromosome 1, for instance. `References` are designed to be immutable.

        isDerived:
          description: A sequence X is said to be derived from source sequence Y, if X and Y are of the same length and the per-base sequence divergence at A/C/G/T bases is sufficiently small. Two sequences derived from the same official sequence share the same coordinates and annotations, and can be replaced with the official sequence for certain use cases.

        md5checksum:
          description: The MD5 checksum uniquely representing this `Reference` as a lower-case hexadecimal string, calculated as the MD5 of the upper-case sequence excluding all whitespace characters (this is equivalent to SQ:M5 in SAM).
          type: string

        sourceURI:
          description: The URI from which the sequence was obtained. Specifies a FASTA format file/string with one name, sequence pair. In most cases, clients should call the `getReferenceBases()` method to obtain sequence bases for a `Reference` instead of attempting to retrieve this URI.
