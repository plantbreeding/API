        title: AlleleMatrix
        description: The AlleleMatrix object is used to describe a matrix of genotyping results. This 2d array of data reduces the overall size of the response for larger datasets, when compared to the Calls endpoints. This makes genotype data retrieval faster and easier.

        variantSetDbIds:
          description: A list of unique identifiers for the VariantSets contained in the matrix response. A VariantSet is a data set originating from a sequencing event.
