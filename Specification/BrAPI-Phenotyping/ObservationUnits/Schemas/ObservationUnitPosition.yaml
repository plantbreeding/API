              MIAPPE V1.1 DM-71 Observation unit type "Type of observation unit in textual form, usually one of the following: study, block, sub-block, plot, sub-plot, pot, plant. Use of other observation unit types is possible but not recommended. 
              The observation unit type can not be used to indicate sub-plant levels. However, observations can still be made on the sub-plant level, as long as the details are indicated in the associated observed variable (see observed variables). 
              Alternatively, it is possible to use samples for more detailed tracing of sub-plant units, attaching the observations to them instead." 
        observationLevelRelationships:
          description: |-
            Observation levels indicate the granularity level at which the measurements are taken. `levelName` 
            defines the level, `levelOrder` defines where that level exists in the hierarchy of levels. 
            `levelOrder`s lower numbers are at the top of the hierarchy (ie field > 0) and higher numbers are 
            at the bottom of the hierarchy (ie plant > 6). `levelCode` is an ID code for this level tag. Identify 
            this observation unit by each level of the hierarchy where it exists.
