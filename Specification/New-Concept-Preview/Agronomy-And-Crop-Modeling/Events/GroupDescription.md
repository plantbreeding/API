# Group Events

An event is discrete occurrence at a particular time in the experiment (which can be natural, such as rain, or unnatural, such as planting, watering, etc). Events may be the realization of Treatments or parts of Treatments, or may be confounding to Treatments. Can be applied at the whole study level or to only a subset of observation units.
