# Group Crops

For multi crop systems this is a useful call to list all the supported crops.




### Get - /commoncropnames [GET /brapi/v2/commoncropnames{?page}{?pageSize}]

List the common crop names for the crops available in a database server. 

This call is ** required ** for multi-crop systems where data from multiple 
crops may be stored in the same database server. A distinct database server 
is defined by everything in the URL before "/brapi/v2", including host 
name and base path.

This call is recommended for single crop systems to be compatible with 
multi-crop clients. For a single crop system the response should contain 
an array with exactly 1 element. 

The common crop name can be used as a search parameter for Programs, 
Studies, and Germplasm.



**Response Fields**

|---|---|---| 
|data|array[string]|array of crop names available on the server|
