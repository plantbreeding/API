# Group Season

A season is made of 2 parts; the primary year and a term which defines a segment of the year. This could be a traditional season, like "Spring" or "Summer" or this could be a month, like "May" or "June" or this could be an arbitrary season name which is meaningful to the breeding program like "PlantingTime_3" or "Season E".
