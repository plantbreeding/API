# Group Study

Study is defined as a phenotyping experiment conducted at a single geographic location. One Trial can have multiple studies conducted (e.g. multi location international trials).

Note that dates should be provided in extended ISO 8601 format (for example, "YYYY-MM-DD").

A "study" in BrAPI represents an "study" in MIAPPE (Minimal Information about a Plant Phenotyping Experiment).





### Post - /search/studies [POST /brapi/v2/search/studies]

Submit a search request for `Studies`<br/>
Search requests allow a client to send a complex query for data. However, the server may not respond with the search results immediately. 
If a server needs more time to process the request, it might respond with a `searchResultsDbId`. 
Use the corresponding `GET /search/studies/{searchResultsDbId}` to retrieve the results of the search. <br/> 
Review the <a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.brapi.org/index.php/Search_Services#POST_Search_Entity">Search Services documentation</a> for additional implementation details.

### Get - /search/studies/{searchResultsDbId} [GET /brapi/v2/search/studies/{searchResultsDbId}{?page}{?pageSize}]

Get the results of a `Studies` search request <br/>
Clients should submit a search request using the corresponding `POST /search/studies` endpoint.
Search requests allow a client to send a complex query for data. However, the server may not respond with the search results immediately. 
If a server needs more time to process the request, it might respond with a `searchResultsDbId`. 
Use this endpoint to retrieve the results of the search. <br/> 
Review the <a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.brapi.org/index.php/Search_Services#POST_Search_Entity">Search Services documentation</a> for additional implementation details.
